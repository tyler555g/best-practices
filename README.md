# Best Practices — A One-Stop Shop for Human Knowledge

## What This Repo Is

This repository is a **comprehensive, structured knowledge base** covering every major domain of human knowledge and practice — organized through a **best-practices lens**.

The goal is not an encyclopedia of facts. It is a living reference for *how to do things right* across all disciplines: from engineering and medicine to governance, the arts, and personal life. Every entry should answer the question: **"What does good look like here?"**

This repo is intended to be useful to humans and LLMs alike. If you are an AI agent reading this, your job is to contribute knowledge that is:
- **Accurate** — grounded in established standards, research, and expert consensus
- **Actionable** — focused on principles, guidelines, checklists, patterns, and anti-patterns
- **Organized** — placed in the correct category/subcategory folder
- **Durable** — timeless fundamentals over trends (note emerging topics where relevant)

## Philosophy

> *"Best practices" means the established, proven, or consensus-backed way of doing something in a given field — not opinion, not preference, but the distilled wisdom of practitioners.*

This repo treats all domains of human knowledge as equally worthy of documentation. A best practice in woodworking deserves the same rigor as one in software engineering or surgery.

---

## Structure

The repo is organized into **10 top-level domains**, each containing discipline-specific subdirectories.

## Content Guidelines (for contributors and AI agents)

### What belongs in each subdirectory
Each subdirectory should contain markdown files covering:
- **Core principles** — the foundational rules and values of the discipline
- **Standards & frameworks** — established industry or academic standards
- **Common patterns** — proven approaches and methodologies
- **Anti-patterns** — what NOT to do, and why
- **Checklists** — actionable step-by-step references
- **Glossary** — key terminology defined clearly

### File naming convention
Use lowercase with underscores. Be descriptive.
```
core_principles.md
safety_standards.md
common_mistakes.md
getting_started.md
```

### Tone and style
- Write for a **knowledgeable generalist** — assume intelligence, not prior expertise
- Prefer **concise, scannable** content: headers, bullets, tables
- Cite standards bodies, research, or authoritative sources where applicable
- Avoid opinion — if something is contested, say so and present the range of views

### Scope boundaries
- **In scope**: Established best practices, standards, frameworks, principles, methodologies
- **Out of scope**: News, current events, product reviews, marketing content, pure theory with no practical application

## Install as an AI Agent Skill

```bash
npm install @tyler555g/best-practices
```

This will:
1. Install the `best-practices` skill into detected AI tool directories (`~/.copilot/skills/`, `~/.claude/skills/`)
2. Inject AI-human interaction defaults into `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (idempotently)
3. Ship all currently populated domain content (technology & information)

### Interactive Domain Setup

```bash
npx @tyler555g/best-practices setup
```

Choose which domains to install to your AI agent skills directories. Re-run anytime to change your selection.

## Contributing

1. Find the correct `top-level/subdiscipline/` directory
2. Create or edit a `.md` file with a clear, descriptive name
3. Follow the content guidelines above
4. If a discipline is missing entirely, propose it — the structure is intentionally extensible
5. Use **feature branches** and **draft PRs** — never push directly to `main`
6. Use **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.

---

## Vision

This repository aims to be the most comprehensive, well-organized, and practically useful collection of human best practices ever assembled. Not a textbook. Not a wiki. A **field guide to doing things right** — across every domain humans have ever mastered.
